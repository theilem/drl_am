# Action Mapping for Deep Reinforcement Learning

### Official code for the paper:
[Action Mapping for Reinforcement Learning in Continuous Environments with Constraints](https://openreview.net/forum?id=3oSauSj0Wk)

by Mirco Theile, Lukas Dirnberger, Raphael Trumpp, Marco Caccamo, Alberto Sangiovanni-Vincentelli.

Accepted at RLC 2025.

## Overview
This repository contains the code to train and visually evaluate two configurations:
- **AM-SAC in a Path Planning Environment**: Action Mapping combined with Soft Actor-Critic in a spline-based path planning environment with non-holonomic constraints.
- **AM-PPO in a Robotic Manipulation Environment**: Action Mapping combined with Proximal Policy Optimization in a robotic manipulation environment with joint limits.
